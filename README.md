# Bridge-iT - A Big/Little matching tool for Big Brothers Big Sisters of Kansas City

## Description

**Duration:** 3 week sprint

**Team:** Caleb Wistuba, Andrew Nguyen, McKenna Lusk, Cole Chelton, Nicole 'Colby' Blechynden

Big Brothers Big Sisters plays an important role in pairing Bigs and Littles. Currently, the process of probing through a lot of summaries, home locations, individual requirements, and using that info to match a Big and Little, has proved to be complex. Bridge-iT is an application that will help to simplify this complex process allowing the staff to concentrate more on the human aspect of making these connections.

Bridge-iT generates a pinned location on a map once the Big or Little information has been loaded. You can reduce the number of pins by selecting preferences or radius. Once the pins have been narrowed, you can select on the toggle button to have a side by side view of the Big and Little profiles. This allows you to easily compare the two profiles and see if the two would be a good match.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostrgeSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

## Installation

- Run `npm install` in your terminal
- Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:
  ```
  SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
  ```
  While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with some long random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep your application secure. Here's a site that can help you: [https://passwordsgenerator.net/](https://passwordsgenerator.net/). If you don't do this step, create a secret with less than eight characters, or leave it as `superDuperSecret`, you will get a warning.
- Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`

- Run `npm run server`

- Run `npm run client`
- Navigate to `localhost:3000`

## Create database and table

Create a new database called `bbbs_matches` and create a `user` table:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE "user" (
    "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    "username" VARCHAR (80) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    "password" VARCHAR (1000) NOT NULL
);
```

If you would like to name your database something else, you will need to change `bbbs_matches` to the name of your new database name in `server/modules/pool.js`

Copy and paste the content of the init.sql file into your database SQL query tool to build the required tables. OPTIONAL: The data.sql file contains sample data for testing, training, demo, or development purposes
